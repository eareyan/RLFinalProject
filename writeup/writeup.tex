Note: Introduce the problem that they're solving, i.e. identify the main research contribution made (a natural language version of theorem 1 ish? that there is this relationship between model accuracy and planning depth, and that gamma lets you control that).

Idea: Discuss how we chose to implement our version of the experiments?

Summary of their results, summary of our results.

% --- SECTION: Reproducibility Discussion ---
\section{Reproducibility Discussion}

Discussion of how reproducing results was difficult, what assumptions we made, what parameters and other bits of info were left from the paper.

For the RockSample:
\begin{itemize}
\item Actual values of UCT exploration bias
\item Gamma
\item Treatment of POMDP with UCT (belief MDP?)
\item Initial state? Randomized? Fixed? Actually super important
\item Initial configuration of rocks?
\end{itemize}
